## Key Features

*   **Developer Leaderboard:** Browse and search for GitHub developers. Ranks are based on a calculated XP score.
*   **XP Scoring System:** Developers earn XP based on stars, forks, followers, weekly commits, and public repository count.
*   **Detailed Developer Profiles:** View individual developer statistics, top programming languages, earned badges, GitHub organizations, and recent repositories.
*   **AI-Powered Insights (Genkit):** Personalized insights into a developer's strengths, badge explanations, and improvement suggestions generated by AI.
*   **Badge System:** Developers earn badges for achievements like "Commit King," "Star Rank," etc.
*   **Dynamic Data Sync:** User data is fetched from the GitHub API and synced with a MongoDB database.
*   **Filtering:** Filter the leaderboard by username, country, programming language, or GitHub organization.
*   **Responsive Design:** Terminal-inspired interface that works across various devices.

## Tech Stack

*   **Framework:** Next.js (with App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with ShadCN UI components
*   **Database:** MongoDB (via Mongoose)
*   **AI Integration:** Genkit (with Google AI's Gemini models)
*   **API:** GitHub API for data sourcing

## Getting Started

You can follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn
*   MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)
*   A GitHub Personal Access Token (for increased API rate limits)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mdrakibulhaquesardar/StarRank-Terminal.git
    cd StarRank-Terminal
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.` file in the root of your project. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if provided, otherwise create from scratch) and fill in the required values:

    ```env
    # .env

    # MongoDB Connection String
    # Example for local MongoDB: MONGODB_URI="mongodb://localhost:27017/starRank"
    # Example for Atlas: MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/starRank?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
    MONGODB_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"

    # GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
    # Create one at https://github.com/settings/tokens with 'public_repo' and 'read:user' scopes
    GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN="your_github_personal_access_token"

    # Public URL of your application (for API calls from client-side)
    # For local development, this will typically be http://localhost:PORT
    # (PORT is 9002 based on your package.json dev script)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:9002"

    # URL to your project's GitHub repository (used in Footer/Header links)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_REPO_URL="https://github.com/mdrakibulhaquesardar/StarRank-Terminal"

    # (Optional) Google AI API Key for Genkit (if using a model that requires it)
    # GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_ai_api_key"
    ```
    **Important:** Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials and URLs. The `.env` file should **not** be committed to version control.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Next.js development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will typically start the application on `http://localhost:9002`.

2.  **(Optional) Start the Genkit development server (for AI feature development/debugging):**
    Open a new terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or for watching changes
    # npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This allows you to inspect and test Genkit flows.

The application should now be running locally.

## API Endpoints

The application uses Next.js API Routes located in `src/app/api/`:

*   `/api/leaderboard`: Fetches paginated and ranked developers. Handles initial seeding if the database is empty.
*   `/api/sync/[username]`: Triggers a sync operation to fetch/update a specific developer's data from GitHub and save it to the database.
*   `/api/users/[username]`: Fetches detailed profile information for a specific developer from the database, including their global rank.
*   `/api/users/[username]/repos`: Fetches a list of public repositories for a specific developer from the database.

## AI Features (Genkit)

This project utilizes Genkit for integrating AI capabilities:

*   **Location:** AI-related code, including flows and prompts, is located in the `src/ai/` directory.
*   **Developer Insights:** The `src/ai/flows/generate-developer-insights.ts` flow uses a Gemini model to analyze developer data (stats, badges) and generate personalized insights, badge explanations, and improvement suggestions. This is displayed on the developer profile page.
